This project demonstrates how to detect specific word patterns in a given text using Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python. It uses the built-in re module to search, match, and extract patterns such as words, numbers, capitalized words, or any custom regex pattern.
The program is designed to be simple, modular, and easy to understand, making it ideal for beginners, students, and learning regex concepts.
